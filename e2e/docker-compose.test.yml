# DEPRECATED: This docker-compose configuration is no longer valid
# The workspace-sdk and workspace-daemon packages have been removed.
# 
# Workspace functionality is now provided by nexusd.
# See e2e/README.md for information on re-enabling E2E tests.
#
# To start nexusd for testing:
#   cd packages/nexusd
#   go run ./cmd/daemon

# This file is kept for historical reference only
# Do not use - references deleted packages

services:
  # NOTE: workspace-daemon service removed - package deleted
  # Use nexusd daemon instead:
  #   cd packages/nexusd && go run ./cmd/daemon
  
  # NOTE: test-runner service disabled - depends on deleted workspace-sdk
  # Tests need to be rewritten to use nexus CLI
