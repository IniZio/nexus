## Enforcer (Implemented)

The Enforcer component is production-ready and actively used.

### Core Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Idle Detection | ✅ | Prevents agents from stopping prematurely |
| Mini-Workflows | ✅ | Enforces documentation, git, CI standards |
| Boulder System | ✅ | Never-stop iteration enforcement |
| Multi-Agent Support | ✅ | OpenCode, Claude, Cursor |

### Mini-Workflows

Implemented enforcement workflows:

1. **Documentation Validation**
   - Checks docs follow project structure
   - Ensures new features are documented
   - Validates AGENTS.md compliance

2. **Git Commit Standards**
   - Enforces conventional commits
   - Validates commit organization
   - Prevents messy git history

3. **CI Verification**
   - Blocks completion until CI passes
   - Runs `task ci` before allowing completion
   - Ensures no type/lint errors

### Statistics

- **Source:** ~4,273 lines
- **Tests:** ~5,598 lines  
- **Coverage:** 1.3:1 ratio
- **Packages:** enforcer, opencode, claude, cursor

---

## Workspace (Implemented)

Inspired by [opencode-devcontainer](https://github.com/athal7/opencode-devcontainer) and [Sprites](https://github.com/peterj/sprites).

### Goals

Provide isolated, reproducible development environments for AI agents:

- **Isolation** - Each task in its own environment
- **Reproducibility** - Same setup every time
- **Remote Execution** - Run agents anywhere
- **Git Integration** - Worktree-based isolation

### Current Status

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Architecture Design | ✅ Complete | Go-based workspace server |
| SDK Protocol | ✅ Complete | WebSocket + JSON-RPC |
| SDK Implementation | 🚧 80% | File ops, exec working |
| Daemon | ✅ Implemented | Go server with Docker backend |
| Docker Integration | ✅ Implemented | Container environments with SSH access |
| SSH Workspaces | ✅ Implemented | SSH-based access with agent forwarding |
| Port Forwarding | ✅ Implemented | Auto-allocated ports (32800-34999) |
| File Sync | 🚧 In Progress | Mutagen integration (partial) |
| Remote Workspaces | 📋 Planned | Cloud-based workspace execution |

### Implemented Features

**Docker Backend:**
- Full Docker Compose support
- Volume persistence across restarts
- Port auto-allocation (32800-34999 range)
- OpenSSH server in each container
- User SSH key injection
- SSH agent forwarding (macOS compatible)

**Workspace Management:**
- Git worktree isolation (`.worktree/<name>/`)
- Automatic branch creation (`nexus/<name>`)
- `nexus workspace ssh` command for interactive access
- SSH-based exec (replaces docker exec)

**Port Allocation:**
- SSH ports: 32800-34999
- Service ports auto-assigned sequentially
- Conflict detection and resolution

## Phase 2: Next Features (Q2 2026)

### Multi-User Support

Enable team collaboration with workspace sharing and resource governance.

**Status:** 📋 Planned - PRD Ready  
**Effort:** Medium (6-8 weeks)  
**Dependencies:** None  

**Features:**
- Organization management (multi-tenant)
- Team collaboration with workspace sharing
- Resource quotas (per org/user)
- Permission levels (owner/editor/viewer)
- Audit logging

**CLI Commands:**
```bash
nexus auth login
nexus org create "Acme Corp"
nexus org invite teammate@acme.com
nexus workspace share feature-auth teammate@acme.com --permission editor
```

See: [004-multi-user.md](./plans/004-multi-user.md)

---

### Web Dashboard

Visual interface for workspace management with real-time monitoring.

**Status:** 📋 Planned - PRD Ready  
**Effort:** Medium (8-10 weeks)  
**Dependencies:** None (can be built in parallel)

**Features:**
- Workspace list with status overview

See: [006-auto-update.md](./plans/006-auto-update.md)

---

## Telemetry (Implemented)

Following the [Agent Trace](https://agent-trace.dev/) specification.

### Vision

Track AI contributions with full provenance:

```typescript
// Example trace record
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "vcs": {
    "type": "git",
    "revision": "abc123..."
  },
  "files": [{
    "path": "src/app.ts",
    "conversations": [{
      "url": "https://nexus.dev/conv/123",
      "contributor": {
        "type": "ai",
        "model_id": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5-20251101"
      },
      "ranges": [
        { "start_line": 10, "end_line": 25 }
      ]
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Use Cases

- **Attribution** - Know what code came from AI vs humans
- **Auditing** - Track which model/conversation produced changes
- **Analytics** - Measure agent effectiveness
- **Compliance** - Document AI involvement for legal/regulatory
